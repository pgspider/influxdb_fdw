# InfluxDB Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL
This PostgreSQL extension is a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for InfluxDB.

The current version can work with PostgreSQL 9.6, 10, 11 and 12.

Go version should be 1.10.4 or later.
## Installation
Install InfluxDB Go client library
<pre>
go get github.com/influxdata/influxdb1-client/v2
</pre>

Add a directory of pg_config to PATH and build and install influxdb_fdw.
<pre>
make USE_PGXS=1 with_llvm=no
make install USE_PGXS=1 with_llvm=no
</pre>
with_llvm=no is necessary to disable llvm bit code generation when PostgreSQL is configured with --with-llvm because influxdb_fdw use go code and cannot be compiled to llvm bit code.

If you want to build influxdb_fdw in a source tree of PostgreSQL instead, use
<pre>
make with_llvm=no
make install  with_llvm=no
</pre>

## Usage
### Load extension
<pre>
CREATE EXTENSION influxdb_fdw;
</pre>

### Create server
<pre>
CREATE SERVER influxdb_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER influxdb_fdw OPTIONS
(dbname 'mydb', host 'http://localhost', port '8086') ;
</pre>

### Create user mapping
<pre>
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR CURRENT_USER SERVER influxdb_server OPTIONS(user 'user', password 'pass');
</pre>

### Create foreign table
You need to declare a column named "time" to access InfluxDB time column.
<pre>
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE t1(time timestamp with time zone , tag1 text, field1 integer) SERVER influxdb_server OPTIONS (table 'measurement1');
</pre>

### Import foreign schema
<pre>
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA public FROM SERVER influxdb_server INTO public;
</pre>

### Access foreign table
<pre>
SELECT * FROM t1;
</pre>

## Features

InfluxDB FDW supports pushed-down functions
- WHERE clauses including timestamp, interval and `now()` functions are pushed down
- Some of aggregation are pushed down such as `influx_time` and `last` functions. These functions does not work on PostgreSQL 9.

## Limitations
- INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE are not supported.

Following limitations originate from data model and query language of InfluxDB.
- Result sets have different number of rows depending on specified target list.
For example, `SELECT field1 FROM t1` and `SELECT field2 FROM t1` returns different number of rows if
the number of points with field1 and field2 are different in InfluxDB database. 
- Timestamp precision may be lost because timestamp resolution of PostgreSQL is microseconds while that of InfluxDB is nanoseconds.
- Conditions like `WHERE time + interval '1 day' < now()` do not work. Please use `WHERE time < now() - interval '1 day'`.
- `GROUP BY time` does not work (([#19](/../../issues/19)).
- Conditions have mix usage of aggregate function and arithmetic do not work ([#18](/../../issues/18)).
- `GROUP BY` does not support FIELD KEY having arithmetic ([#17](/../../issues/17)).
- `GROUP BY` only works with time and tag dimensions ([#16](/../../issues/16)).
- `GROUP BY` does not work with duplicated targets ([#15](/../../issues/15)).
- Aggregate functions with arithmetic in parentheses are not supported ([#14](/../../issues/14)).
- String comparisons do not work except `=` and `!=` ([#13](/../../issues/13)).
- `GROUP BY` works for only tag keys, not for field keys([#3](/../../issues/3))

When a query to foreing tables fails, you can find why it fails by seeing a query executed in InfluxDB with `EXPLAIN (VERBOSE)`.
